To make the code in here available to mzscheme programs in general:

Put this directory into your PLTCOLLECTS environment variable, like this:

export PLTCOLLECTS="$PLTCOLLECTS:this-directory"

Then in your code, do something like

(require (lib "howdy.ss" "offby1"))


I suppose I should really upload this stuff to planet.plt-scheme.org.
